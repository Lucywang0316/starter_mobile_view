        <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

        <p>Perfect Chinese steamed egg. Soft, smooth, and tender steamed egg (蒸鸡蛋) is a comforting food for lots of Chinese children and a time-saving dish for house cooks.

            <li>Transfer the strained egg liquid into small bowls. Remove any bubbles on the surface if there are any. If you are using a large plate, then simply strain the egg liquid to the plate.</li>
            <li>Set up the steamer, bring the water to a boil, and slow down the fire to simmer for 9 to 12 minutes depending on your container.</li>
            <li>Remove from the fire and wait for 5 minutes to cool down a little bit. Transfer the containers out. Drizzle some sesame oil and light soy sauce and garnish with chopped spring onion on top.</li>

        <h2>Swedish Pancakes</h2>
        <span>Origin: Sweden</span>d

        <img src="images/swedish-pancakes-platted.jpeg" width = "200" alt="Swedish Pancakes on a plate with fruit.">
        <p>Swedish pancakes (Pannkaka [singular] or Pannkakor [plural] in Swedish) are one of the most well-known Scandinavian delicacies, and rightfully so. Tender, buttery and often served with butter and lingonberry jam, there is much to account for their popularity.
        </p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Vanilla</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until completely smooth.Transfer to the refrigerator to rest for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees if you plan to eat the pannkakor right away.  Heat a 10 inch nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Stir the batter briefly to recombine. Brush skillet with melted butter.  Pick the skillet up off of the burner and quickly add ¼ cup of batter. Immediately begin swirling the batter around the skillet so that it coats the bottom of the pan.  Continue swirling until the batter is just set.  Return skillet to the burner. Cook until the pancake is golden brown in spots on the bottom, about 30 seconds. Use a thin spatula to loosen the pancake, flip it over continue to cook on the other side for about 30 seconds.  Transfer to a plate. Cover with foil and transfer to oven to keep warm and repeat with remaining batter, wiping out skillet in between pancakes with paper towel as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve with lingonberry jam and butter (see note below) or other desired toppings and/or fillings. See notes below for more information about making ahead of time and storing in the refrigerator or freezer.</li>
        </ol>
